            <b>Active Therapy Systems LLC (ATS)</b> May 2022 - Jan 2023
            <br/>
            At ATS I was responsible for creating code for multiple aspects of the both site and an android application.  
            On the site I wrote PHP for generating PDF files based on data given to me through an API call. I also helped in 
            creating a android application, I was responsible for making static helper classes and a graphing system that would map 
            out a patients blood pressure over time. Finally, I performed quality checks on the site and application to report 
            any major or minor bugs that may have appeared during development.

            <b>This website:</b><br/>
            This website is hosted on an Apache24 server located on my home computer. 
            All HTML, PHP, and JavaScript/ECMAScript code running on this site has been developed by me. 
            Additionally, I have implemented a tunneling system to bypass the need for a static IP address, 
            which would typically be provided by my ISP
        </p>
        <p class="pProject" id="unity">
            <b>Unity Projects:</b>
            <br/>
            I have undertaken various mini projects within Unity to explore the software's capabilities. Here are a few examples:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Developed a 2D game enabling players to navigate through a virtual museum showcasing NASA projects.
            <br/>
            2. Created an interactive walkthrough illustrating Supreme Court rulings on specific cases, providing insights into judges' opinions.
            <br/>
            3. Implemented simple AI behaviors within 2D environments to simulate enemy interactions against a player.
            <br/>
            4. Designed a basic battle arena game where the player combats endlessly spawning adversaries, testing combat mechanics and endurance.

            <b>Unreal Engine:</b>
            <br/>
            Within unreal engine I have created multiple small horror games with a group of 4 people. We created was a game with a simple objective of finding a key and escaping a monster 
            in a large house. 
            We made a game where the player wanders into an abandonded mine where the entrance then colapses 
            behind them. The player must then make their way through the mine, avoiding any dangers that pop 
            up as they travel further in. 
            <br/>
            I have also spent time testing out the possibilities the engine gives a developer on a small scale.

            <b>Discord Bot:</b>
            <br/>
            Using JavaScript I created a bot that I could use on my discord server to generate pictures from the internet 
            based on a prompt given by any user. The bot could also act as a moderation tool by performing various administrator  
            tasks at a significantly quicker pace if given a specific command.

            <b>Blender:</b>
            <br/>
            I primarily use blender to create models for games and 3D printing, though have done some animation within the 
            tool as well.

        <p class="pProject" id="Bingo">
            <b>Bingo Game:</b><br/>
            I have developed a simple automated Bingo system which adheres to the rules of traditional Bingo. It can be found here: 
            <a href="Bingo.php" style="color:blue">Bingo.php</a>
        </p>
        <p class="pProject" id="Bingo">
            <b>Weather API:</b><br/>
            I created a JavaScript/ECMAScript based webpage
            that allows users to retrieve weather data from 
            an online API based on latitude and longitude coordinates,
            along with their preferred units. Users can input these details, 
            and the site will display the relevant information.

            <b>DBMS Project:</b><br/>
            A group of students and I had to compile and 
            manipulate an open source DBMS. We ended up 
            using FirebirdDB with the goal of creating 
            significantly faster query speeds on frequently used 
            queries. This was done by using a wrapper that would 
            moniter all used queries, and store the most common ones 
            in a cache. The queries were removed based on a TTL, and 
            eventually replaced. This showed significant gains in speed 
            by roughly 30%.
